# youtube-reception
ML Project to predict the Reception (like-dislike ratio) to a trending YouTube video based on its other features. The power of such a prediction lies in allowing content creators to assess the public reaction to their videos and making use of this information to correct or supplement future videos. The regression problem will seek to minimise the RMSE in tuning and deciding between a justified selection of models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. The results will be analysed, and contextual links will be made to justify the observed patterns in the results presented in the report.
